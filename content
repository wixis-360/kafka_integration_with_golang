Kafka is an open-source event streaming platform for high-throughput publishing and processing of events. There are numerous popular Go libraries for interacting with Kafka.
Apache Kafka is used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications.
Kafka enabled the ingest of millions of metric points per hour without sacrificing performance.

The following are some of the benefits of employing systems like Apache Kafka.

1. Increased Reliability
Queues make your data persistent by allowing other parts of the system to communicate with the queue even if one element of the system is unreachable.
2. Improved Performance
Endpoints that are producing and consuming messages interact with the queue, not each other, to enable asynchronous communication.
3. Scalability
Message queues enable you to scale precisely where you need to when workloads peak.
